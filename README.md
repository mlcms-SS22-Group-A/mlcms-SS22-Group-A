In the python notebook exercise-1.ipynb each task has a different code cell
that can be run to simulate that task. The initial state of cellular automaton
can be inputted in the corresponding "task" + task_number + ".txt" file 
in the directory input/. The speeds.txt file in the root directory can be 
used to assign specific speeds to each pedestrian that is placed in the 
scenario.
